This is a tower defense game created for the Godot Wild Jam #48.

Programming by discord user raghu3848

Interactions and Game Design by discord user raghu3848, Heather Cole (discord user ProfCole), and discord user egorkin531.

There is a parsing error in this project since initially created that is unresolved. It is likely due to version change, or maybe something was worked on past the project's end date that raghu3848 has since forgotten

It is functional...you can win...but it is tough as is.
